Linear Regression is a method to predict dependent variable (y) based on values of an independent variable (x). It can be used be cases where we want to predict some continuous quantity. Both variables vary linearly btw each other. An example. Stock price and time are linearly dependent on each other The dependent variable is the stock price and the independent variable is Time. 

Logistics regression is a method used to predict a dependent variable, given a set of independent variables, such that the dependent variable is categorical. The dependent variable also called the response variable holds values like, yes or no, 0 or 1, A, B or C. The independent variable also called the predictor variable is used to predict the response variable. An example is classifying emails as spam or Not Spam
